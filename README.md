## ABOUT

```diff
- NOTE: THIS LIBRARY IS BEING PROTOTYPED AND UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT.  PLEASE VISIT LATER... FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE STABLE! ;)
```

**Unseen** is a micro-library designed to provide a robust and performant foundation for building SPAs and other front-end applications.

It is a library - in the Backbone.js sense - that provides developers with a selection of core components that they can use or ignore as their needs require.  

It does not force "buy-in" to some one all encompassing framework of UI Truth!  So unlike many other "solutions", you will not have to refactor your entire codebase to be able to use what it offers!

For example, if you want to use Unseen's powerful data model and back-end support - but with React or Vue providing the visuals - you can.
